# MAGIC Large Language Models produce some amazing results, chatting and answering questions with seeming intelligence. But how can you get LLMs to answer questions about _your_ specific datasets? Imagine answering questions based on your company's knowledge base, docs or Slack chats. The good news is that this is easy with open-source tooling and LLMs. This example shows how to apply `langchain`, Hugging Face `transformers`, and even Apache Spark to answer questions about a specific text corpus. It uses the Dolly LLM from Databricks, though this example can make use of any text-generation LLM or even OpenAI with minor changes. In this case, the data set is a set of freely available published papers in PDF format about cystic fibrosis from PubMed, but could be any corpus of text.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Cluster Setup
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Run this on a cluster with Databricks Runtime 13.0 ML GPU. It should work on 12.2 ML GPU as well.
# MAGIC - To run this notebook's examples _without_ distributed Spark inference, all that is needed is a single-node 'cluster', with a single A10 GPU (ex: `g5.4xlarge` on AWS). A100 instances work as well.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In all events, otherwise start with required Python libraries:

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %pip install -U transformers langchain chromadb pypdf pycryptodome accelerate arxiv unstructured unstructured[local-inference] sacremoses

# COMMAND ----------

dbutils.widgets.dropdown('model_name','databricks/dolly-v2-7b',['databricks/dolly-v2-7b','databricks/dolly-v2-3b'])

pdf_path = "/tmp/langchain_hls/pdfs/"
hf_cache_path = "/dbfs/tmp/cache/hf"
db_persist_path = "/dbfs/tmp/langchain_hls/db/"

# COMMAND ----------

import os
# Optional, but helpful to avoid re-downloading the weights repeatedly. Set to any `/dbfs` path.
os.environ['TRANSFORMERS_CACHE'] = hf_cache_path
os.environ["PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF"] = "max_split_size_mb:512"

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Data Prep
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This data preparation need only happen one time to create data sets that can then be reused in later sections without re-running this part.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Grab the set of PDFs (ex: Arxiv papers allow curl, PubMed does not)
# MAGIC - We have also manually uploaded a few PDFs from PubMedCentral relating to Cystic Fibrosis, but any topic area would work
# MAGIC - If you already have a repository of PDFs then you can skip this step, just organize them all in an accessible DBFS location

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC ! (rm -r /tmp/pdfs || true) && \
# MAGIC   mkdir /tmp/pdfs && \
# MAGIC   cd /tmp/pdfs && \
# MAGIC   mkdir -p /dbfs{pdf_path} && \
# MAGIC   curl --no-progress-meter -L https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07991.pdf -o 1803.07991.pdf && \
# MAGIC   cp -r /tmp/pdfs/ {pdf_path}
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ```

# COMMAND ----------

!ls /dbfs{pdf_path}/pdfs

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Prepare Document DB
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now it's time to load the texts that have been generated, and create a searchable database of text for use in the `langchain` pipeline. 
# MAGIC These documents are embedded, so that later queries can be embedded too, and matched to relevant text chunks by embedding.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Use `langchain` to reading directly from PDFs, although LangChain also supports txt, HTML, Word docs, GDrive, PDFs, etc.
# MAGIC - Create a simple in-memory Chroma vector DB for storage
# MAGIC - Instantiate an embedding function from `sentence-transformers`
# MAGIC - Populate the database and save it

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Prepare a directory to store the document database. Any path on `/dbfs` will do.

# COMMAND ----------

!(rm -r {db_persist_path} || true) && mkdir -p {db_persist_path}

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Create the document database:
# MAGIC - Here we are using the `DirectoryLoader` loader from LangChain ([docs page](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/document_loaders/examples/directory_loader.html)) to form `documents`; `langchain` can also form doc collections directly from PDFs, GDrive files, etc.
# MAGIC - `DirectoryLoader` here is inferring document type and using PDFMiner under the hood, so we have to import that package as well

# COMMAND ----------

from langchain.docstore.document import Document
from langchain.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader
from langchain.document_loaders import PDFMinerLoader

loader_path = f"/dbfs{pdf_path}/pdfs"

loader = DirectoryLoader(loader_path)
docs = loader.load()
len(docs)

# COMMAND ----------


# For PDFs we need to split them for embedding:
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(        
    separator = "\n\n",
    chunk_size = 1000,
    chunk_overlap  = 200,
    length_function = len,
)
documents = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)

# COMMAND ----------

display(docs)

# COMMAND ----------

sample_query = "What is cystic fibrosis?"

hf_embed = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name="sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2")
db_persist_path = db_persist_path

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Building a `langchain` Chain
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now we can compose the database with a language model and prompting strategy to make a `langchain` chain that answers questions.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Load the Chroma DB
# MAGIC - Instantiate an LLM, like Dolly here, but could be other models or even OpenAI models
# MAGIC - Define how relevant texts are combined with a question into the LLM prompt

# COMMAND ----------

# Start here to load a previously-saved DB

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Note that there are _many_ factors that affect how the language model answers a question. Most notable is the prompt template itself. This can be changed, and different prompts may work better or worse with certain models.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The generation process itself also has many knobs to tune, and often it simply requires trial and error to find settings that work best for certain models and certain data sets. See this [excellent guide from Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate). 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The settings that most affect performance are:
# MAGIC - `max_new_tokens`: longer responses take longer to generate. Reduce for shorter, faster responses
# MAGIC - `k`: (below): the number of chunks of text retrieved into the prompt. Longer prompts take longer to process
# MAGIC - `num_beams`: if using beam search, more beams increase run time more or less linearly
